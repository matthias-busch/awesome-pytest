# Awesome Pytest Resources - A Comprehensive Collection of Testing Resources

This list contains a bunch of links to pytest resources that should be valuable to beginners as well as intermediates
or more senior folks.

## Books

- [Python Testing with pytest 2nd Edition (Brian Okken)](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/python-testing-with/9781680509427/): Really comprehensive in-depth book that covers all the basics not only in theory but also has many
step-by-step working examples. Brian has also released a accompanying course that is also linked below. But this book
is definitely a great starting point to learn how `pytest` works.


## Online Resources

### Websites

- [Official pytest docs](https://docs.pytest.org/): This is the official pytest documentation site which should give you
everything you need to know to install and configure pytest on your machine. You'll also find a bunch of guides for
specific reference topics and how-to start guides:
  - [Fixtures Reference](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/reference/fixtures.html)
  - [Configuration](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/reference/customize.html)
  - [Talks and Tutorials](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/talks.html): Officially maintained list of talks and tutorials.


### Courses

- PyCon / EuroPython
  - [Pandy Knight: def test_crash_course_with_pytest()](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yq3M8Yj-uX0): This recording
  of a workshop session from Pycon US 2024 really matches its title. Pandy Knight gives a really comprehensive crash
  course to `pytest` covering all the relevant topics on not only how pytest works but also on how to use it
  professionally.
  - [Florian Bruhin: pytest - simple, rapid and fun testing with Python (3 hours)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofPHJrAOaTE): Content-wise pretty similar to Pandy Knight's crash course but presented in a different style (the dude is one of pytest's maintainers).
- [Brian Okken's - The Complete pytest Course (Companion to the Python Testing with pytest book)](https://courses.pythontest.com/the-complete-pytest-course): This online course accompanies the book mentioned at the beginning. While I haven't started it yet, Brian's work (e.g., his writings) is typically of high quality.
- [calmcode.io](https://calmcode.io): calmcode is a treasure trove of small, comprehensive, to-the-point mini-courses on a variety of Python topics. They offer two short, worthwhile courses on pytest:
  - [pytest/introduction](https://calmcode.io/course/pytest/introduction)
  - [pytest-tricks/parametrize-twice](https://calmcode.io/course/pytest-tricks/parametrize-twice)

### Blogs, Articles & Tutorials

- [Brian Okken's blog about pytest](https://pythontest.com/blog/): Authored by the writer of the aforementioned book and course.
